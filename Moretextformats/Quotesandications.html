        There's much written on www about history of the Internet.For example, about the first graphical Internet browser on the web - Mosaic. <br>
        <br><blockquote>
               Mosaic is the first widely-used graphical<br>
               World Wide Web browser, released on April 22, <br>
               1993 by the NCSA with the help of Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina.<br>
               A big competitor to Mosaic was Netscape, which was released a year later.</blockquote> <br>
        <br>
        <p></p>Today's Internet browsers we use today<br>
        (e.g., Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox, etc.),<br>
        got their inspiration from the Mosaic browser.</p><br>
